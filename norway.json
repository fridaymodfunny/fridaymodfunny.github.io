This is also reflected in educational and professional settings: there is, for instance, rarely a strict dress code.<br><br>That said, it is worth noting that there has been a significant change in recent years. In keeping with the rise of the minimalist Nordic/Scandinavian style, we see increasing numbers of formally dressed (and well-dressed) Norwegians &ndash; both young and old. The same tendency towards formality is also evident in other areas of public life, for instance in conversation and public debate. This shift towards formality does not mean that Norwegians leave their all-weather jackets and practical shoes at home, or adopt more formal forms of address. It is rather a sign that Norwegians, as a result of increasing globalisation and prosperity, have learned to adapt to the expected etiquette.</p>"
